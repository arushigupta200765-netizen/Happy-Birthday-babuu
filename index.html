    <h1>🎀To my baby🎀</h1>
    <p>Praneeth, my baby, can you believe it like even in this long ass distance We are still here, together, getting stronger and bond deepening, i still can't believe you are still here with me</p>
    <p>Remembering back then when we first talked and now looking at us, haha i mean look how far we have came together, Even though there were times when we felt down, distant, far away, separated and almost ended things, but i never had the thoughts of leaving you, we are still here today, together forever, stronger and this is how I want us to be forever</p>
    <p>You are my better and other half, i don't wanna lose this one, let's stick together till death do us apart I have a lot of plans for us, and I want them to be with YOU, there's no me without you anymore, you matter a lot lot more than you might think, i find happiness in your, i feel safe with you, i feel comfortable, i feel free, i hope we stay this way forever</p>
    <p>Okay sorry sorry this is supposed to be about you not me haha back to it, you know the first time we talked, i genuinely thought you were some boring ass adult, busy with shit tons of things and immediately thought him and I are not compatible at all now who would have thought you will have me stuck with you like a leech, and trust me when I say this, you are not getting away from me easily</p>
    <p>I know i know words are not all that effective but i promise I'll show you everything I say, i mean it Well tbh past few months were really hard, i thought we were done for good, i mean distance really is scary sometimes but seems like my prayers worked and I got my praneeth back the one i know, thankyou for not giving up I'm so so grateful, i maybe not in a position to make your birthday any special, but i promise when I get the chance i won't let it slide, I'm just waiting for now, can't really do as much as you did, I'll just wait for my turn</p>
    <p>Everything we have shared from our first call to our first fight lol, i cherish every single thing, thank you for making my life better and colourful As today it's your day baby, but i think I'm more excited than you areeee, the sweetest human was born today, and the best part is that he is my freaking boyfriend, like damn</p>

      <div class="card"><p>1) your kind and charming personality, since the first day i loved it how you were always so disciplined and deliberate and always made sure i was happy and loved</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p>2) your weird ass humour, even though it's not as good as mine but still you are funny (not more than me), i mean come on they are lame asf but still somehow you end up making me laugh</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p>3) your small and warming efforts, though you would be busy all day you would still make out some time to talk to me and tell me you will be busy</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p>4) how you have always been so understanding, whether it was my mood swings, when i couldn't text, when i couldn't call, you never once made me feel guilty about it or like i was wasting your time, you always understood and tried your best to console me</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p>5) how i can freely talk to you about anything without any hesitation, how safe i feel sharing anything with you, whether its about my family, friends, things i don't understand and you explaining while making sure i don't feel dumb:3</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p>6) how you have always given me reassurance whenever i felt down and had doubts without getting irritated for repeating the same thing</p></div>
      <div class="card"><p>7) thank you for always tolerating my bullshit, when i was mean and rude to you for absolutely no reason and giving you the hard time or when i might have hurt you with something i didn't acknowledge, thank you for staying</p></div>
